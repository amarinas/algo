#Write a program that inserts a new number X at an index Y. For example if array = [1, 3, 5, 7] and X = 10, and Y = 2, by the end of your program array should be [1, 3, 10, 5, 7] (in other words we added '10' on index 2). Check the output of your array once your program is completed to make sure it's working correctly.


def insert(arr, x, y):
    if len(arr) < y or y < 0:
        return False
    else:
        arr[y] = x
    return arr


print(insert([1, 3, 5, 7], 11, -3))
