#Write a program that takes an array of numbers and returns an array where the first and last numbers in the array have been switched.For example say x = [2, 3, 5, 7, 6]. By the end of the program x, should be [6, 3, 5, 7, 2]. Do this without creating an empty array.

def swap(arr):
    temp = arr[0]
    arr[0] = arr[len(arr)-1]
    arr[len(arr)-1] = temp
    return arr


print(swap([6, 3, 5, 7, 2]))
